Welcome to my new blog. I've been wanting to start a blog documenting some of the things I've discovered through coding for a while now but had never got around to it. Over the last few months I've been learning a lot about different languages and techniques and thought I could share some of the knowledge that I've gained. So here it is.

So what can you expect. I mostly focus on iOS development and have been for a while. So expect a lot of iOS, Objective-C and Swift but I also like to delve into other languages. There have been a lot of new languages coming out recently and I've been really looking forward to learning some of them. So you can expect to possibly see some of that. 

I'm looking forward to sharing my experience and hopefully help others in the process.
